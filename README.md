# UrbanHive

Ordinary web project that receives a random message form the user and automatically fetches another one,
 within the database,and shows it to the user.

The idea is to create a somewhat 'social-experience' when people around the globe send-and-receive messages from
other people. The focus id on interface acessibility,  which is the solely reason this application is being made.
